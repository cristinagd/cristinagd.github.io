		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="images/Cristina.jpg" alt="A photo of me">
		<p> My name is Cristina Diaz, I am a full time student at Colorado State  University- Pueblo. 
		I am currently a sophomore  majoring in Mass communication and Business Marketing. 
		I love meeting new people and  building  friendships. My  hobbies are designing different things and watching  movies. 
		I am a team leader and strive to be the best I can be. I am a person who likes things to be fair, and I hate when people take advantage of others.
		In this world, no one is more than anyone. Treating people with respect is important to me. <p>

		<p> I have lived in Pueblo, Colorado my whole life. I came from a big family. We are six sisters and two brothers. 
		Family is  very important to me as well as  being humbled.  When I was younger,  college didn't  even come  across my mind.
		I went  to  highschool  and thought  that after school I was going to find a good job. 
		It wasn't until my senior year that i was really  focused and  wanting to  attend College. 
		I  started asking  for help  from my counselors. 
		Once I started to  know that I was  going to be  able to attend  college when I started  to  get more into the whole concept of college and what I needed to do. <p>  

		<p> I am an opportunity seeker and I find doors that are going to give me opportunities.
		My first year  at my college were the best, I met the most helpful and  humble people.
		I was  able to meet people that are a huge influence in my life  as well.
		I've always worked hard for what I want and when I make up my mind about  something, I won't stop until it  gets  done.
		This has helped me  get far and achieve  my goals that I set for myself. <p>  

		<p> My mom has been a huge part of my life  as well, always  there giving me  support and being my right shoulder. 
		She  has given everything i  needed  to be successful  and more. 
		Everything I do is for her because I want her to  be proud of me. 
		I also do it  for my family because I am the  first of eight siblings  to attend college. 
		I want my nieces and nephews to have someone to look up to.
		I didn't  have that person to lead me towards college and I  want to be a leader for my family members. <p> 

		<p> Having goals is something important  to me as well, goals help us  have a motivation  in life towards something.
		I have many goals, and every day I worked hard to achieve them.
		I believe we are all capable of anything.
		We are all smart, just putting our full focus and having faith in us we are able to achieve anything. 
		If they can do it, why can't you? I have a favorite quote that my sister once told me, and it says “I'm not better than anyone, but nobody is better than me” I am me, and everything I  do is to help me. 
		I want to be the best that I can be for myself. <p>
